# Uncommon HTML Error: Unexpected Behavior After innerHTML on Div

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to unexpected behavior when removing a div element's content using `innerHTML`. Subsequent DOM manipulations might still affect the empty div, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from the way `innerHTML` modifies the DOM. While it clears the content within the element, the element itself remains in the DOM tree. Any subsequent attempts to manipulate this now-empty element will still work, possibly causing unexpected side effects.

## Solution

Instead of using `innerHTML` to remove content and potentially create issues, the best approach is to use `removeChild`. This method completely removes the element from the DOM tree, avoiding any confusion or unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the behavior. The div is hidden, its content is removed, but it is still a part of the DOM.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected implementation.
